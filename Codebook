Scope: The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.

A. Assign each data to variables

dataFeaturesNames <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

activityLabels <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

dataSubjectTest <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed

dataFeaturesTest <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data

dataActivityTest <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities code labels

dataSubjectTrain <- train/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed

dataFeaturesTrain <- train/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data

dataActivityTrain <- train/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities code labels

B. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set dataCombine C. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement tidydata.txt : 180 rows

D. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set activityLabels

E. README Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

F.Dataset Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

G. Files CodeBook.md a code book that describes the details of the steps

H. Scripts run_analysis.R performs the below steps

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
